This project is a small mini interpreter written in C#. It lets the user type simple arithmetic expressions and then calculates the result. The program supports integers, basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, as well as parentheses. The main goal of this project is to better understand how expressions are evaluated step by step and to practice basic programming concepts such as functions, loops and recursion.
